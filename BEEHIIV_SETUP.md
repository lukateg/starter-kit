## Usage

The new `NewsletterSubscriptionForm` component can be used anywhere in your app:

```tsx
import { NewsletterSubscriptionForm } from "@/components/newsletter-subscription-form";

// Basic usage (no label)
<NewsletterSubscriptionForm />

// With all options
<NewsletterSubscriptionForm 
  utmCampaign="footer"
  utmSource="website"
  utmMedium="footer-form"
  placeholder="Your email address"
  buttonText="Subscribe Now"
  showLabel={true}  // Shows "Email Address" label
  onSuccess={(data) => {
    console.log('New subscriber:', data.email);
    // Track in analytics, etc.
  }}
/>
```

### Component Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `utmCampaign` | string | "waitlist" | UTM campaign for tracking |
| `utmSource` | string | "website" | UTM source for tracking |
| `utmMedium` | string | "form" | UTM medium for tracking |
| `placeholder` | string | "Enter your email" | Input placeholder text |
| `buttonText` | string | "Count Me In ðŸš€" | Submit button text |
| `showLabel` | boolean | false | Whether to show "Email Address" label |
| `className` | string | "" | Additional CSS classes |
| `onSuccess` | function | undefined | Callback function on successful submission |

### Architecture

The system now uses modern Next.js patterns:

- **Server Actions**: `subscribeToNewsletter()` handles all backend logic
- **Custom Hook**: `useNewsletterSubscription()` manages form state and transitions
- **Pure UI Component**: Form component only handles display and user interaction
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic in server actions, UI logic in components

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- A proper loading spinner component
- Analytics tracking for form submissions
- A/B testing for different form variations
- Integration with your analytics platform (PostHog, etc.)
- Additional custom fields (name, company, etc.)
