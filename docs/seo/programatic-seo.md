# Programmatic SEO – Step-by-Step Guide

A simplified process for creating hundreds or thousands of SEO-optimized pages at scale using automation and templates.

---

## 1. Find Keywords (Low KD, High Volume)
- Use tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMrush**, **Ubersuggest**, or free keyword tools.
- Target keywords that are:
  - **Low Keyword Difficulty (KD)** → easier to rank
  - **Good search volume** (100–10,000 searches/month)
  - **Long-tail & specific** (e.g., “best hiking boots for flat feet”)
- **Goal:** Identify search intents you can target with one scalable page template.

---

## 2. Build a Webpage Skeleton
- Create **one generic template** in HTML/Next.js/WordPress, etc.
- This template will be duplicated for **each keyword**.
- Example structure:
  - Header → “Best {Product/Service} for {Location/Use Case}”
  - Intro paragraph
  - Pros/cons section
  - Table or comparison chart
  - FAQ section
- **Goal:** Avoid designing each page manually — use one layout to scale.

---

## 3. Collect and Stuff Data
**Collect** = gather structured data for your topic.  
**Stuff** = insert that data into your template dynamically.

### Examples:
- **Best coffee shops in {City}**:
  - Data: names, addresses, ratings, images, opening hours
  - Sources: scraping Google Maps/Yelp, APIs, CSV lists, public datasets
  - Fill template → replace `{City}`, populate table/list with coffee shop data

- **How to {task} in {year}**:
  - Data: tips, tools, stats, year-specific updates
  - Sources: scrape, use APIs, or manually write content

### Methods:
- Hire a **data entry freelancer**
- Write a **scraper or API integration**
- Manually collect for smaller-scale tests

**Goal:** Each page feels **customized, specific, and useful** for that keyword.

## 4. Technical SEO Optimization
Make sure each page has:
- **Unique title tag**: `Best Coffee Shops in Austin (2025 Guide)`
- **Unique meta description**
- **Internal links** to related pages
- **Images with descriptive alt tags**
- **Schema markup** (LocalBusiness, FAQ, Product, etc.)
- Mobile-friendly, fast-loading

---

## 5. Get Backlinks
- Outreach to:
  - Local bloggers
  - Niche directory owners
  - Forums and communities
  - Business partners
- Methods: guest posts, collaborations, press releases
- Even **5–10 relevant backlinks** can boost ranking significantly.

---

## 6. Index Website
- Submit **sitemap.xml** in Google Search Console
- Use “Request indexing” for important pages
- Wait for Google crawl and ranking

---

## Extra Steps for Success
- **Content enrichment**: Add explanations, comparisons, tips.
- **Unique intros**: Use AI or manual writing for uniqueness.
- **User-generated content**: Reviews, comments.
- **Regular updates**: Refresh data to show page freshness to Google.
