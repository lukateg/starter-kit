## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Structure
- **One `<h1>` tag** (main headline)  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <h1>ClearAudit ‚Äì The SEO Audit Tool for Non-SEOs</h1>
Logical heading hierarchy: <h2> for section titles, <h3> for subpoints.

Meta Title: ‚â§ 60 characters, keyword + brand.
Example:
"ClearAudit ‚Äì Simple SEO Audits for Non-Experts"

Meta Description: ‚â§ 160 characters, compelling + keyword.
Example:
"Run instant, plain-English SEO audits without subscriptions. Get actionable tips in seconds."

Mobile-friendly: Use responsive design and test in Chrome DevTools.

Fast load speed: Optimize images (use WebP), lazy load non-critical assets.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Content & Keywords
Use your primary keyword naturally in:

Title tag

H1

First paragraph

At least 1‚Äì2 <h2> headings

Image alt text

Use related terms:
"SEO audit tool", "website SEO check", "SEO for beginners", "site audit without subscription".

Write a short intro paragraph explaining what problem you solve (Google prefers a contextual intro under the H1).

3Ô∏è‚É£ UX & Engagement Signals
Above-the-fold CTA: Visible without scrolling.

Include internal links (e.g., to /pricing or /features) ‚Äî helps crawling.

Outbound link to a relevant, high-quality source.

Include at least one image with descriptive alt text containing your keyword.

Optional: Add a small interactive element in the hero section to catch attention (e.g., ‚ÄúGet a quick SEO tip‚Äù button, fake score meter, or playful animation).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Trust & Social Proof
Add testimonials (from beta testers or early feedback).

Add your name/brand in the footer with a short blurb ‚Äî helps E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

Include a contact email or form for trust and legal compliance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Accessibility
Lighthouse SEO score depends heavily on:

Performance (fast load times, optimized assets)

Accessibility (alt text, correct HTML structure)

Mobile-friendliness (tap targets, viewport meta tag)

Use semantic HTML (avoid <div>-only layouts).

Test on https://pagespeed.web.dev/ before publishing.

üî• Pro Tip
Since it‚Äôs a single page, include one section (300‚Äì500 words) describing:

Who the tool is for

Problems it solves

How it works
