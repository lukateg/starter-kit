# SEO Authority Building

> **Purpose**: Founder-level guidance for building domain authority, E-E-A-T signals, and backlink strategy. These are actions YOU take as a founder — not code patterns. For code-level SEO rules (metadata, URL structure, keyword placement), see `DOCS/CORE/SEO_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.

## E-E-A-T: Off-Site Signals

E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is how Google evaluates whether your site deserves to rank. It applies to every niche, not just health/finance. More E-E-A-T = rank higher, rank faster, rank longer (more durable against algorithm updates).

### Business directories

- Submit to **general business directories** (Google Business Profile, Yelp, Crunchbase, etc.)
- Submit to **niche-specific directories** relevant to your industry
- Use **descriptive language** in all submissions — tell search engines what you do and what areas you cover

### Social media presence

- Have profiles on major platforms
- **Post at least once every couple of months** — dead/inactive profiles are worse than no profiles
- Doesn't need to be frequent, just alive

### Thought leadership & backlinks

- **Go on podcasts** — you control the language in episode descriptions, and you get backlinks
- Guest posts, interviews, and mentions on other sites all build authority
- The key: you're building a pattern of being recognized across the web as someone in this space

## E-E-A-T: Content Strategy Signals

These are editorial decisions, not code patterns:

- **"How We Create Content" page** — Explains your editorial process (especially valuable for blogs)
- **"Write for Us" page** — Shows you're open to expert contributions, signals authority in the niche
- **Non-keyword-targeted posts** — Write some posts that aren't targeting any keyword: why you care about your niche, industry opinions, case studies, product updates, new features. This shows Google you're genuinely active in your industry, not just farming keywords
- **Use your own images** alongside stock — product screenshots, team photos, service images signal authenticity and real experience

## Linkable Assets & Domain Authority

Domain authority determines how competitive a keyword you can rank for and how fast you rank. The best way to build it: create something on your site so cool, useful, or interesting that people naturally link to it.

### What is a linkable asset

Anything on your site that earns backlinks organically because people want to share it:
- **Free tools/calculators** — interactive utilities that solve a micro-problem
- **Original data/research** — stats, benchmarks, analyses people cite
- **Curated resource pages** — "best tools for X" recommendations
- **Podcasts/newsletters** — content people reference and link to

The key: it must be genuinely useful standalone. If nobody would share it without being asked, it's not a linkable asset.

### The share feature hack

When building any linkable asset (tool, calculator, generator), **always include a share feature**. When users share results from your tool, each share is a link back to your domain. This compounds domain authority massively.

Example: A simple web app that generates something funny/useful → user gets a result → clicks "Share" → a dedicated page is created for that result → that URL gets shared on social media → backlinks to your domain accumulate.

### When you need backlinks

Backlinks matter most in three cases:
1. **New site** — no existing domain authority to leverage
2. **Very competitive, high-volume keywords** — need authority to outrank established players
3. **Keywords outside your niche** — going after topics you're not yet known for

For all other cases (bottom-of-funnel keywords in your niche on an established site), you likely have enough authority already.

## Bottom-of-Funnel Keyword Strategy

Most SEOs chase high-volume top-of-funnel keywords (exploratory, informational). This is a mistake:

| | Top-of-funnel | Bottom-of-funnel |
|---|---|---|
| **Intent** | Learning, exploring | Ready to purchase/sign up |
| **Competition** | Very high (every SEO targets these) | Often low (overlooked) |
| **Conversion** | Low (no purchase intent) | High (knows what they want) |
| **Ranking speed** | Slow (competitive) | Fast (less competition) |
| **Durability** | Volatile | Stable and sustainable |
| **Backlinks needed** | Many | Few or none (if site isn't brand new) |

**Prioritize bottom-of-funnel purchase-intent keywords.** They take the least work, rank faster, convert better, and align with Google's guidelines.

## AI-Proofing Your SEO

This strategy works across Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AI models recommend pages from authoritative domains. Bing (which powers ChatGPT search) uses backlinks to evaluate authority. Building domain authority future-proofs you regardless of which search interface wins.

Bottom-of-funnel SEO is especially AI-proof — when people know what they want, they search for it whether they use Google or ask ChatGPT. A purchase-intent click is a purchase-intent click regardless of the source.
