# TODO:

check before launch:
// - check if all components are server components if possible
-- add maximum pdf size per prompt when generating text so we do not exceed AI limit per prompt

// - since a lot of logic is based on the URLS, implement fallback when user types jibrish in the url so it doesn't break your backedn and frontend
// - remove pdfItems from getLessonData, these need to be separated
// - check why uploading calls 3 requests and is so slow ///
// -- Refactor working test form
-- create suspense component for pending and error state
-- retry test first flashes the test then loads loader

ZA SUTRA:
// -- refactor create test route
// -- create proper retry logic when calling AI
// -- extract logic for parsing the PDF
-- add validation if test title exist so user cannot have two same entities in database
-- add chunking text prompt

PRE OVOGA MORAS POCISTITI SVE STO STOJI U NAPOMENAMA GORE
-- add modals on all needed actions
-- Add delete and edit
-- maybe add settings page
-- Add analytics
-- add payments
-- check free tier plan and work out permisions and free plan

MAYBE IN FUTURE
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGs (setting up if user wants all questions on one page, or he wants pagination)
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGS (if user wants to have only one question true when multiple questions)
-- add additional prompt section to test generation so user can add additional instruction for test
--  add dashboard for number of lessons, pass rate, total tests, test review in one of the navigation to single class page
-- implement custom question number per lesson
-- add abort test generating when clicking on the X in the loader
-- maybe add sharing tests between user as a social media app

# Teach-me core features and strategie

## Core Differentiating Features
These will set Teach.me apart from competitors and make it valuable for students.

1. AI-Powered Test Generation (Unique Twist)

âœ… Upload PDFs â†’ AI understands the content â†’ Generates structured quizzes, flashcards, and practice tests.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements: 

Difficulty Scaling â€“ AI adapts questions to user progress (e.g., easier first, harder later).
Smart Answer Explanations â€“ AI provides detailed explanations instead of just "Correct" or "Wrong."
Multiple Testing Modes â€“ MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, and AI-generated essay topics.


2. Study Timeline & Smart Scheduling

Interactive Mode â€“ AI asks questions mid-way through to keep users engaged.
Voice Commands â€“ "Pause," "Summarize this section," "Give me a quiz on what I just heard."
ðŸ”¹ Competitor Gap: Other apps just read text aloud; this would make it interactive & educational.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Auto Highlighting â€“ AI marks important sections in user-uploaded PDFs.
