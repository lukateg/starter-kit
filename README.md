# TODO:

// - think about removing a context and just using queries because you have live updates and sockets

// - implement custom question number per lesson
// - upload material button page should have a dropdown menu of lections to be linked when uploading materials (fetch lections from API)
// - each section has its own functionallity button. lessons section -> create lesson, materials section -> upload materials....
// - remove pdfItems from getLessonData, these need to be separated

// - add delete everything logic
// - add edit everything logic
// - check if all components are server components if possible
// - check why uploading calls 3 requests and is so slow ///
// - change new-class/lesson to create-class/lesson

// for selecting the lessons for test generation use table for lessons. 
// e.g. in table render all lessons. 
// --- single lesson -> table acts like radio button (after selecting one element disable all other)
// --- multiple lesson -> table acts like checkbox list (after selecting all elements trigger selecting whole class testing)
// --- class test -> table selects all checkboxes in table and disables unchecking

// -- Refactor form
// -- create proper retry logic when calling AI
// -- refactor create test route
// -- extract logic for parsing the PDF
// -- hook up all form inputs to the AI route
-- implement view tests page so you can open already generated test to not use AI tokens 
-- add maximum pdf size per prompt when generating text so we do not exceed AI limit per prompt

TOMOROW:
-- add chunking text prompt

LATER:
-- implement loading when generating test
-- implement test review
-- store review in database

LATER: 
-- implement responsive menu and mobile version and start implementing test generator page

# Teach-me core features and strategie

## Core Differentiating Features
These will set Teach.me apart from competitors and make it valuable for students.

1. AI-Powered Test Generation (Unique Twist)

âœ… Upload PDFs â†’ AI understands the content â†’ Generates structured quizzes, flashcards, and practice tests.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements: 

Difficulty Scaling â€“ AI adapts questions to user progress (e.g., easier first, harder later).
Smart Answer Explanations â€“ AI provides detailed explanations instead of just "Correct" or "Wrong."
Multiple Testing Modes â€“ MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, and AI-generated essay topics.


2. Study Timeline & Smart Scheduling

âœ… AI analyzes uploaded materials â†’ Creates a personalized study plan based on exam dates & learning pace.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Calendar Integration â€“ Sync study schedule with Google Calendar.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Structured Audio Lessons â€“ AI summarizes key topics before reading.
Interactive Mode â€“ AI asks questions mid-way through to keep users engaged.
Voice Commands â€“ "Pause," "Summarize this section," "Give me a quiz on what I just heard."
ðŸ”¹ Competitor Gap: Other apps just read text aloud; this would make it interactive & educational.


4. AI-Powered Smart Notes & Summarization

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Auto Highlighting â€“ AI marks important sections in user-uploaded PDFs.
