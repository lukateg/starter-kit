# TODO:

// - think about removing a context and just using queries because you have live updates and sockets
// - since a lot of logic is based on the URLS, implement fallback when user types jibrish in the url so it doesn't break your backedn and frontend
// - implement custom question number per lesson
// - remove pdfItems from getLessonData, these need to be separated

// - add delete everything logic
// - add edit everything logic
// - check if all components are server components if possible
// - check why uploading calls 3 requests and is so slow ///
// - change new-class/lesson to create-class/lesson

// -- Refactor form
// -- create proper retry logic when calling AI
// -- refactor create test route
// -- extract logic for parsing the PDF
// -- hook up all form inputs to the AI route
-- add maximum pdf size per prompt when generating text so we do not exceed AI limit per prompt
-- add chunking text prompt
-- add validation if test title exist so user cannot have two test or test reviews with same name
-- add modals on all needed actions
-- use const user = await currentUser(); from clerk for all API routes
-- FIX infinite bottom when scrolling all the way down
-- Server-Side Rendering with Next.js add preloadQuery for preloading data on the server

-- IN SINGLE CLASS VIEW: add dashboard for number of lessons, pass rate, total tests, test review
- add navigation for test review alongside existing tests

LATER: 
-- no tests found not working on generate tests page

-- generate test from test page, with dropdown menu to select class and then map fetch the lessons for selection
-- layout reconsiliation
-- Implement mobile design
-- remove all spinners and add proper suspense skeleton
-- Add delete and edit
-- maybe add settings page
-- Add analytics
-- add payments
-- check free tier plan and work out permisions and free plan

# Teach-me core features and strategie

## Core Differentiating Features
These will set Teach.me apart from competitors and make it valuable for students.

1. AI-Powered Test Generation (Unique Twist)

âœ… Upload PDFs â†’ AI understands the content â†’ Generates structured quizzes, flashcards, and practice tests.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements: 

Difficulty Scaling â€“ AI adapts questions to user progress (e.g., easier first, harder later).
Smart Answer Explanations â€“ AI provides detailed explanations instead of just "Correct" or "Wrong."
Multiple Testing Modes â€“ MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, and AI-generated essay topics.


2. Study Timeline & Smart Scheduling

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Auto Highlighting â€“ AI marks important sections in user-uploaded PDFs.
