# TODO:

check before launch:
// -- add maximum pdf size per prompt when generating text so we do not exceed AI limit per prompt
// -- check if all components are server components if possible
// -- check if there is better retry logic when calling the AI
// -- check if there is better way to add chunking text prompt
// -- check if all routes are covered with the fallback and if URL security is enough

-- remove pdfItems from getLessonData, these need to be separated
-- check why uploading calls 3 requests and is so slow ///
-- create suspense component for pending and error state
-- retry test first flashes the test then loads loader

-- check if permisions for tests are needed so we avoid scenario where anyone can access other peoples tests


PRE OVOGA MORAS POCISTITI SVE STO STOJI U NAPOMENAMA GORE
-- Add delete and edit
-- add modals on all needed actions
-- maybe add settings page
-- Add analytics
-- add payments
-- check free tier plan and work out permisions and free plan

MAYBE IN FUTURE
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGs (setting up if user wants all questions on one page, or he wants pagination)
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGS (if user wants to have only one question true when multiple questions)
-TEST GENERATION
-- add additional prompt section to test generation so user can add additional instruction for test
-- add importing previous tests when generating test so AI knows not to generate same questions
--  add dashboard for number of lessons, pass rate, total tests, test review in one of the navigation to single class page
-- implement custom question number per lesson
-- add abort test generating when clicking on the X in the loader
-- maybe add sharing tests between user as a social media app

FUTURE FEATURES:
- test sharing between users and groups
- test preview before starting to work on it
- audio lessons

# Teach-me core features and strategie

## Core Differentiating Features
These will set Teach.me apart from competitors and make it valuable for students.

1. AI-Powered Test Generation (Unique Twist)

âœ… Upload PDFs â†’ AI understands the content â†’ Generates structured quizzes, flashcards, and practice tests.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements: 

Difficulty Scaling â€“ AI adapts questions to user progress (e.g., easier first, harder later).
Smart Answer Explanations â€“ AI provides detailed explanations instead of just "Correct" or "Wrong."
Multiple Testing Modes â€“ MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, and AI-generated essay topics.


2. Study Timeline & Smart Scheduling

âœ… AI analyzes uploaded materials â†’ Creates a personalized study plan based on exam dates & learning pace.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Calendar Integration â€“ Sync study schedule with Google Calendar.
Adaptive Learning â€“ If a user struggles with certain topics, the AI re-prioritizes them in the schedule.
Reminder System â€“ Smart notifications for "Revision Time" and "Test Yourself Today."


3. Voice-Powered Learning (AI Voice from PDFs)

âœ… AI reads PDFs aloud but does more than basic text-to-speech.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Structured Audio Lessons â€“ AI summarizes key topics before reading.
Interactive Mode â€“ AI asks questions mid-way through to keep users engaged.
Voice Commands â€“ "Pause," "Summarize this section," "Give me a quiz on what I just heard."
ðŸ”¹ Competitor Gap: Other apps just read text aloud; this would make it interactive & educational.


4. AI-Powered Smart Notes & Summarization

âœ… AI extracts key points from PDFs â†’ Converts them into bullet points & flashcards.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Auto Highlighting â€“ AI marks important sections in user-uploaded PDFs.
Context-Aware Flashcards â€“ AI automatically creates Q&A pairs based on key concepts.
ðŸ”¹ Competitor Gap: Quizlet requires manual input, but Teach.me auto-generates study materials.

ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:

Smart Reports â€“ AI analyzes user performance & suggests focus areas.
Confidence Level Indicator â€“ Users rate their confidence before & after each test to see improvement.
Streaks & Badges â€“ Encourage consistency (e.g., "You studied 5 days in a row!").
